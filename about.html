        <h3>My Education</h3></p>
        <p>
            I have an Associate's degree in Graphic Design from Passaic County Community College and I will be
            completing my Bachelor's in Information Technology from NJIT this fall semester.

        <h3>My Job Experience</h3></p>
        <p>
            I worked retail for a number of years as a sales associate. There I learned many people interaction and
            communication skills. I worked as a Geek Squad consultation and repair agent which tested many of my
            troubleshooting abilities. I interned as a Software Developer a previous summer and I am now working as
            a Systems Engineer.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>My Future</h3></p>
        <p>
            I plan on continuing to grow my knowledge and experience in order to grow my career. Eventually I would
            like to obtain my Master's degree and ultimately work somewhere where I can combine my passions for
            technology and helping others to give back!
